# MTR-Template Code of Conduct

## Short Version
Our team is dedicated to fostering an inclusive, harassment-free community and research environment for everyone. Our code of conduct is detailed below.

## Long Version
Our team is committed to providing an open, inclusive, and respectful environment for researchers, developers, and contributors from all backgrounds. We welcome participation regardless of ethnicity, nationality, gender identity or expression, age, ability, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, economic background, academic or professional experience, employment status, and other differences.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form, whether in discussions, repositories, meetings, or online platforms associated with MTR-Template. Harassment includes but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce structures of domination
- Bullying, intimidation, or threats
- Offensive language or media
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Stalking, following, or harassing behavior
- Unauthorized use of othersâ€™ work without credit
- Sharing confidential or sensitive information without consent
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or collaborations
- Inappropriate physical contact

If your behavior is called out as disrespectful, we encourage you to reflect, apologize, and strive to improve your actions in the future.

By contributing to or using the MTR-Template repository, you agree to abide by this code of conduct in all repository-related discussions, collaborations, and events. This policy applies equally to contributors, maintainers, sponsors, and other community members. Online identities should be clearly recognizable, and administrators reserve the right to request changes to usernames that do not align with this principle. Violations of this code may result in warnings, removal from discussions, or permanent bans from the repository and associated platforms.

## Reporting and Consequences
If you experience or witness harassment, or have concerns regarding violations of this code of conduct, please report the issue to the repository maintainers. Reports will be handled confidentially.

Maintainers will review reports, gather input if necessary, and determine appropriate actions, including but not limited to:

- Issuing warnings
- Removing content that violates the code of conduct
- Temporarily or permanently banning individuals from participating in the repository
- Escalating the matter to relevant institutions or authorities if necessary

We value your contributions and strive to maintain a welcoming and respectful research community.
