CONTRIBUTING STATEMENT 

You can contribute by honouring, recognizing, respecting, and valuing the memory of the Indigenous peoples of the Andes, as well as the ancestral wisdom that inspired the original forms of the Electronic_Khipu_ and the  Kanchay_Yupana//

By doing so, you can contribute without seeking extractivism or cultural appropiation. Use sustainable materials whenever possible, and be mindful of your available resources.

It's important to remember that khipus were originally knotted by khipukamayoks, who dedicated their lives to studying these intricate structures to learn how to encode them. We must appreciate this ancestral knowledge.

Learn about Khipus and Yupanas by building your own interfaces, performing with them at concerts, or composing sound. However, it is not only about the technical aspects of these NIMEs. Do this with respect and acknowledgement for their historical and social significance.

Patricia Cadavid, the author of these reinterpretations, adheres wih her ideas to "The Technokhipumancers' Neokhipukamayoq Manifesto," written by the artist and khipumancer Paola Torres Nu√±ez del Prado.
